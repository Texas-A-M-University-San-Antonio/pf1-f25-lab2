# pf1-lab2
This is the Lab 2 repository for demonstrating the creation of a GitHub assignment, mostly generated by GitHub Copilot to help improve overall lab and create test cases to automate my code solutions.

**BEGIN DEMO**
Welcome to your Lab 2! If you made it here, that means you successfully accepted the assignment in Blackboard and are just about ready to begin coding

**Step 1**: Add your name to Line 2

**Step 2**: Add the date to Line 3

**Step 3**: Add the correct lab number to Line 4

**Step 4**: To prepare for performing these physics calculations, consider a simpler case: a force is calculated as mass multiplied by acceleration. Write a program that accepts user input for both the mass and the acceleration of an object and then calculate the force being applied to that object. Display the result to the user. The program flow might look like the following:

Please enter the mass of the object (kg): 10
Please enter the acceleration of the object (m/s^2): 5
The force being applied to the object is 50 N.

Be mindful of syntax, double quotations, and parentheses. Don't forget the semicolon!

**Step 5**: Run the code and ensure the expected output displays.
